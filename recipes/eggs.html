      <p><em>2 Perfectly cooked eggs</em></p>
    <p>Grandma Bishop eggs are better than yours. <strong>Period.</strong> I dare you or your loved ones to fry up an egg like this. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 farm fresh eggs</li>
      <li>1 pinch of pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>On medium heat, melt butter in cast iron skillet.</li>  
      <li>When butter is melted and slightly bubbling, crack 2 eggs in pan. Salt and pepper should now be added, so it cooks in.</li>
      <li>When it feels right, flip eggs over. (You will know when this is. At least Grandma Bishop always did.)</li>
      <li>Remove eggs from pan and serve with toast and bacon.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the best eggs of your life</li>
    </ol>
